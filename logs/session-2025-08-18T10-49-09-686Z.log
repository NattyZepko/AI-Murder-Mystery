[2025-08-18T10:50:39.022Z] USER -> Lena Grant: Hello, Lena. How are you this evening?
[2025-08-18T10:50:43.055Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *nervously plays with hair* I'm... fine, I suppose. Just trying to process everything that's happened. It's all been a bit of a shock, to be honest. *avoids eye contact*
[2025-08-18T10:51:06.927Z] USER -> Lena Grant: Where were you last night?
[2025-08-18T10:51:12.293Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *fidgets* I was asleep in my quarters, like I always am when I'm on duty at night. I don't see how that could have anything to do with... what happened. *tugs on a strand of hair* Do you think it's possible someone else could have... um, used the [33mlantern[0m[32m [33moil[0m[32m [33mcan[0m[32m? It's not something we usually keep in our quarters, but I guess it's not impossible... *trails off*
[2025-08-18T10:51:44.802Z] USER -> Lena Grant: used the lantern oil, how?
[2025-08-18T10:51:49.670Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *nervously laughs* Oh, no, no, I didn't mean to imply that. I just meant that... well, someone might have needed to access the [33mlighthouse[0m[32m's storage for something else entirely. Not that they would use the [33mlantern[0m[32m [33moil[0m[32m for... anything suspicious. *avoids eye contact again*
[2025-08-18T10:52:32.926Z] USER -> Lena Grant: who could have access to the storage?
[2025-08-18T10:52:38.330Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *gulps* Well, there are a few of us who have keys to the storage room. [31mEthan Blackwood[0m[32m, [31mCaspian Nightshade[0m[32m, and [31mAstrid LaFleur[0m[32m all have access... *pauses, looking around nervously* But I'm sure they would never use their privileges for something like this. It's not like them at all... *starts playing with her hair again*
[2025-08-18T10:53:08.766Z] USER -> Lena Grant: Hey Lena? don't you have access as well?
[2025-08-18T10:53:13.961Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *looks down, voice barely above a whisper* Ah, y-yes, I do have a key to the storage room... but that doesn't mean anything. I just use it for... research and stuff. Yeah. *avoids eye contact, fidgeting with her hair again*
[2025-08-18T10:53:26.366Z] USER -> Lena Grant: research? of what?
[2025-08-18T10:53:32.721Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *nervously clears throat* Oh, just... Captain's research projects. He was working on some papers about the [33mweather[0m[32m patterns around here, and I was helping him gather data from the [33m[33mweather[0m[32m [33mstation[0m[32m [33mtool[0m[32m[0m. But that's all just routine stuff, nothing to do with... what happened. *tries to change subject* Did you know that [31mEthan Blackwood[0m[32m has been acting suspiciously lately? I've seen him arguing with Captain on several occasions...
[2025-08-18T10:54:04.884Z] USER -> Lena Grant: weather?
[2025-08-18T10:54:11.346Z] AI(Lena Grant) -> USER: *looks up, eyes darting around the room* Ah, no, not just [33mweather[0m[32m. The Captain's research was about... *pauses, choosing words carefully* ...the effects of [33mstorm[0m[32m patterns on our [33mlighthouse[0m[32m's emergency procedures. He wanted to make sure we were prepared for any situation that might arise during a [33mstorm[0m[32m. *trails off, eyes dropping back down to her hands*
