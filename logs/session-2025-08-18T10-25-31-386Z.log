[2025-08-18T10:27:35.948Z] USER -> Caspian Blackwood: Hello caspian, do you know what happened here last night?
[2025-08-18T10:27:41.834Z] AI(Caspian Blackwood) -> USER: (laughs) Oh, dude, I was out fishing, just chillin' on the water, catchin' some rays and a few fish, too. Didn't see nothin', but I heard there was some drama goin' down at the coast. You know how it is, right? (slouches further, eyes darting around)
[2025-08-18T10:28:02.109Z] USER -> Caspian Blackwood: no, i don't know how it is, please enlighten me
[2025-08-18T10:28:08.289Z] AI(Caspian Blackwood) -> USER: (smirks) Nah, never mind, bro. Let's just say I'm a pretty chill guy, and drama's not really my scene. But, uh, I did see Eleanor earlier that night... we had a bit of a disagreement, yeah? (pauses, eyes squinting) She was all bent outta shape about somethin', but I don't wanna get into it. That's just between us, you feel me?
