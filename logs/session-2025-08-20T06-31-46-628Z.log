[2025-08-20T06:56:44.238Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: Hello Axel
[2025-08-20T06:56:49.134Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: What do you want? Can't say I'm pleased with the... distractions around here.
[2025-08-20T06:56:56.278Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: Introduce yourself
[2025-08-20T06:57:00.867Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: Axel Vonn, at your service. [33mEngineer[0m[32m by trade, but I've been... otherwise occupied of late. (pauses) My reputation precedes me, I suppose.
[2025-08-20T06:57:22.473Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: You SUPPOSE? where were you last night at 22:47?
[2025-08-20T06:57:28.058Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: (scoffs) You think you can pin something on me that easily? I was in Module 6, Isolation Quarters. In a private session with Captain Blackwood... (pauses, eyes narrowing) or so she would have had you believe.
[2025-08-20T06:58:04.627Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: what do you mean by that? is that false?
[2025-08-20T06:58:12.166Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: (leaning in, voice taking on a menacing tone) Let's just say I was... indisposed. My presence with Captain Blackwood was... understood between us. But if you want to know more about my whereabouts, ask her yourself. (pauses, eyes glinting with a hint of challenge)
[2025-08-20T06:58:30.810Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: you don't scare me
[2025-08-20T06:58:36.377Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: (smirks) Ah, how... refreshing. Most people would be trembling in their boots by now. (leans back, arms crossing) I suppose that's what makes you so... interesting. (eyes flick to the [33mFerro-[33mSulphur[0m[32m [33mCatalyst[0m[32m[0m[32m nearby, but he says nothing about it)
[2025-08-20T06:58:54.785Z] USER -> Axel Vonn: What are you looking at?
[2025-08-20T06:59:00.097Z] AI(Axel Vonn) -> USER: (eyes return to you, gaze piercing) Oh, just a little... reminder of the tools we have available. (pauses, voice dropping to a whisper) And perhaps a hint at what's been used in your investigation so far.
[2025-08-20T06:59:14.808Z] USER -> Dr. Elliot Thompson: Hey, Elliot!
[2025-08-20T06:59:19.368Z] AI(Dr. Elliot Thompson) -> USER: What's on your mind? I'm a bit... frazzled at the moment. Can't seem to focus with all this commotion going on.
[2025-08-20T06:59:33.088Z] USER -> Dr. Elliot Thompson: what commotion? is something wrong?
[2025-08-20T06:59:38.676Z] AI(Dr. Elliot Thompson) -> USER: Yes, you know, the victim. Dr. Vonn. Terrible business. Still can't believe it happened. I was just... um... in Module 1, Life Support Control at the time of death, as I'm sure Captain Blackwood and Dr. Singh can attest.
[2025-08-20T07:00:15.131Z] USER -> Dr. Maya Singh: Hello Maya
[2025-08-20T07:00:19.640Z] AI(Dr. Maya Singh) -> USER: What do you want? I'm busy trying to figure out who killed our colleague. Not that I care about the victim's opinion on my research, but still...
[2025-08-20T07:00:36.403Z] USER -> Dr. Maya Singh: Huh? wereyou enemies?
[2025-08-20T07:00:42.421Z] AI(Dr. Maya Singh) -> USER: Enemies? Ha! We had our differences, let's put it that way. His opinions on my containment procedures were... misguided. But that doesn't mean I'd kill him. I was working in Module 4, Hydroponics Lab at the time of death. You can check with Dr. Thompson and [31mLena Grant[0m[32m, they'll vouch for me.
[2025-08-20T07:00:58.051Z] USER -> Captain Zara Blackwood: Hey Zara
[2025-08-20T07:01:04.441Z] AI(Captain Zara Blackwood) -> USER: By the stars, what's this? You're investigating me, too? I've got nothing to hide. My alibi checks out - I was on the command center at the time of... you know, the incident. Dr. Thompson and [31mLena Grant[0m[32m can vouch for it. What do you want to know?
[2025-08-20T07:01:21.895Z] USER -> Dr. Maya Singh: hello Maya
[2025-08-20T07:01:26.917Z] AI(Dr. Maya Singh) -> USER: What do you want? I'm busy working on the hydroponics system in Module 4. You're not here to bother me with idle chit-chat, are you?
[2025-08-20T07:01:46.051Z] USER -> Dr. Maya Singh: but I am. I'd like to know where you were yesterday at 22:47
[2025-08-20T07:01:51.362Z] AI(Dr. Maya Singh) -> USER: That's an easy one. I was right here in the Hydroponics Lab, Module 4. Dr. Thompson and [31mLena Grant[0m[32m can vouch for me - they both verified my alibi. What's this about, anyway?
