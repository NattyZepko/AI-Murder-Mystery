[2025-08-18T11:27:44.109Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: Hello Astrid, how are you this evening?
[2025-08-18T11:27:48.901Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: I'm... shaken, to be honest. I just can't believe what's happened. *fidgets nervously* I keep thinking about the [33mRavenswood [33mletter[0m[32m [33mopener[0m[32m[0m[32m... it's just so... fancy. I mean, who needs a [33mletter[0m[32m [33mopener[0m[32m like that? *trails off*
[2025-08-18T11:28:14.178Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: Why do you keep thinking about that letter opener? what's so special about it?
[2025-08-18T11:28:20.324Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *nervously laughs* Oh, no reason, really. I just... uh... remember seeing it on the coffee table when I came over to visit Mr. [33mRavenswood[0m[32m last week. It's just a very... distinctive object. *fidgets with hands* I mean, I've never seen anything like it before. *pauses* But, between you and me, I'm more worried about Dr. [33mPatel[0m[32m's alibi. She was acting so suspiciously that night...
[2025-08-18T11:28:50.702Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: where was she?
[2025-08-18T11:28:56.920Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *nervously clears throat* Ah, Dr. [33mPatel[0m[32m? Oh, I think she said something about being in the garden, checking on the plants or something. *looks away* But, to be honest, I didn't really see her myself. *fidgets with hands again* I was just... uh... in my room, trying to relax before dinner. Yeah, that's it. My door was unlocked, but I was definitely alone. *gulps*
[2025-08-18T11:29:23.842Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: Being alone? that's a poor alibi. You sure nobody saw you?
[2025-08-18T11:29:29.762Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *nervously laughs again* Oh, no, no one saw me! I'm positive. *pauses* I mean, I didn't see anyone suspicious around the house either. Just... just normal stuff. *gulps* But, between you and me, Cormac was acting weird that night too. He kept muttering to himself in the library... *trails off*
[2025-08-18T11:29:49.487Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: cormac? who's cormac?
[2025-08-18T11:29:56.408Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *nervously smiles* Oh, [31mCormac Fraser[0m[32m! He's just a friend of Mr. [33mRavenswood[0m[32m's. He was visiting that night too. *pauses* But I'm sure he had nothing to do with... what happened. *fidgets with hands again* I mean, I don't think it was anyone we know who did it. *looks around nervously* It must have been some kind of... random break-in or something. *tries to change subject* Do you think the police will find any clues? Maybe something on [33mDr. [33mPatel[0m[32m's [33mscalpel[0m[32m[0m[32m?
[2025-08-18T11:30:40.705Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: wait, patel has a SCALPEL?! that sounds dangerous!
[2025-08-18T11:30:47.487Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *stammers* Oh, no, no, it's just... uh... a medical thing. Dr.  [33mPatel[0m[32m is a doctor, after all. *nervously chuckles* I'm sure she uses it for... for legitimate purposes only. *pauses* But, speaking of knives, I did find something strange earlier... my [33mkitchen[0m[32m [33mknife[0m[32m was missing from its block when I went to make dinner that night. *looks down, fidgeting with hands again*
[2025-08-18T11:30:58.429Z] USER -> Astrid Wallace: hey
[2025-08-18T11:31:03.711Z] AI(Astrid Wallace) -> USER: *looks up nervously* Oh, yeah? What is it? *leans in slightly, eyes darting back and forth* Am I... am I a suspect or something? *voice trembles slightly*
