[2025-08-18T10:32:20.020Z] USER -> Lysander Thane: hello Lysander, how are you this evening?
[2025-08-18T10:32:25.382Z] AI(Lysander Thane) -> USER: *fidgets with pocket watch* I'm...fine, thank you for asking. Still trying to process everything that's happened. It's just so...sudden. And I keep thinking about the state of Dr. Vex's research lab. The equipment was still humming when I left earlier that day... *trails off*
[2025-08-18T10:32:45.965Z] USER -> Lysander Thane: what was your relationship with Dr. Elara?
[2025-08-18T10:32:50.621Z] AI(Lysander Thane) -> USER: *nervously adjusts pocket watch again* Oh, we were colleagues, friends...I mean, acquaintances. We worked on similar projects, but our research interests diverged over time. I'm just...still trying to understand why anyone would want to hurt her. *pauses, eyes darting around the room*
[2025-08-18T10:33:05.979Z] USER -> Lysander Thane: do you have any idea who would want to hurt her?
[2025-08-18T10:33:11.882Z] AI(Lysander Thane) -> USER: *fidgets with pocket watch some more, avoiding eye contact* Ah, well...I don't know if I should say this, but [31mKaida Reyes[0m[32m and Dr. Vex had a bit of a...disagreement over funding for their respective projects. And then there's [31mCaspian Blackwood[0m[32m...he's been acting strange lately, always lurking around the lab after hours. *leans in closer* But I'm sure it was just a coincidence, really. *gulps*
[2025-08-18T10:33:55.335Z] USER -> Lysander Thane: that's a lot of gossiping... you sure do seem suspicious
[2025-08-18T10:34:01.703Z] AI(Lysander Thane) -> USER: *takes a step back, eyes widening in alarm* Oh no, no, no! I'm not suspicious at all! I'm just...concerned about the investigation, that's all. *fidgets with pocket watch again* I mean, I was actually checking the lighthouse's mechanicals around the time of the murder. I have a witness who can vouch for me...I think. *trails off, looking uncertain*
[2025-08-18T10:34:30.603Z] USER -> Lysander Thane: what is in your pocket, good sir?
[2025-08-18T10:34:35.945Z] AI(Lysander Thane) -> USER: *nervously pats pocket, trying to hide what's inside* Oh, just my trusty pocket watch and...um, some spare change. Yes, that's all. *accidentally lets slip a glimpse of the rusty old pipe wrench peeking out from his pocket before quickly covering it up*
