[2025-08-18T09:18:49.273Z] USER -> Cedric 'Ced' Patel: Hello cedric, where were you last night at 11:45 PM?
[2025-08-18T09:18:53.872Z] AI(Cedric 'Ced' Patel) -> USER: *pauses slightly before responding in a calm tone* I was... uh, in the kitchen, making some tea. Yes, that's right. I recall now, I had just put the kettle on when I heard a noise coming from upstairs. *eyes narrow slightly, as if recalling the scene*
[2025-08-18T10:05:25.006Z] USER -> Cedric 'Ced' Patel: what happened then?
[2025-08-18T10:05:35.538Z] AI(Cedric 'Ced' Patel) -> USER: *fidgets ever so slightly, lips pursed* I went to investigate... and that's when I saw the, uh, mess in Eleanor's room. I didn't want to touch anything, so I just stood there for a moment, trying to process what was happening. *avoids direct eye contact*
[2025-08-18T10:05:59.357Z] USER -> Cedric 'Ced' Patel: Look at me, please, cedric
[2025-08-18T10:06:03.970Z] AI(Cedric 'Ced' Patel) -> USER: *slowly raises eyes to meet yours, still calm but with a hint of nervousness* Ah, yes... *pauses, then looks away again* I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just... just Eleanor's room in disarray. *fidgets fingers together*
