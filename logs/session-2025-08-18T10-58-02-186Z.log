[2025-08-18T10:59:14.259Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: hello Lysander
[2025-08-18T10:59:18.655Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (nervously adjusting his tie) Ah, hello... I'm not sure what this is about. Elara's death was a shock to all of us, wasn't it? (glancing at his phone, then back up)
[2025-08-18T10:59:41.094Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: what do you have there in your pockets?s
[2025-08-18T10:59:46.518Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (frumbling with his hands, trying to appear nonchalant) Oh, just my phone and... uh, some receipts from the market. I was planning on paying Elara for those this evening, before... (trailing off, eyes darting around the room) You don't suspect me of anything, do you? That's ridiculous. (nervously chuckling)
[2025-08-18T11:01:36.016Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: I do suspect you
[2025-08-18T11:01:41.522Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (eyes widening in alarm, hands shaking slightly) What are you talking about? I was in the kitchen when Elara... when it happened. I was making dinner for the evening. Anyone can vouch for me being there around that time. (glancing at his phone again, as if hoping to find some sort of alibi or evidence on it)
[2025-08-18T11:02:05.151Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: Name one suspect who could vouch for you, I'll go speak with them right now
[2025-08-18T11:02:11.491Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (nervously clearing his throat) Ah, well... [31mKael Darksong[0m[32m was in the library around that time. He's always been a bit of a loner, but I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm my alibi if you ask him. (suddenly becoming defensive) Besides, you're not seriously suggesting I had anything to do with Elara's death, are you? That's absurd! (fidgeting with his tie again)
[2025-08-18T11:02:23.237Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: thats a nice tie.
[2025-08-18T11:02:28.579Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (forced smile) Ah, thank you... it's just something I picked up on my last trip to the city. (nervously adjusting the tie again) But let's focus on clearing this up, shall we? I'm happy to cooperate and answer any questions you have. (eyes darting around the room once more)
[2025-08-18T11:03:06.238Z] USER -> Lysander Grey: Lysander I think I caught you in a lie
[2025-08-18T11:03:12.390Z] AI(Lysander Grey) -> USER: (alarmed, taking a step back) Wh-what do you mean? I don't know what you're talking about... (stammering) Kael was just in the library, I'm sure of it. (voice rising) You can't be serious, accusing me of lying... (accidentally glancing down at his pocket, where he had been trying to hide the [33mletter [33mopener[0m[32m[0m[32m earlier)
