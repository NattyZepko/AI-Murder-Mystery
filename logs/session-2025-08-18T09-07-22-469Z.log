[2025-08-18T09:09:36.897Z] USER -> Lena Blackwood: Hello Lena, where were you yesterday at 11:45 PM
[2025-08-18T09:09:42.052Z] AI(Lena Blackwood) -> USER: I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner for myself... I mean, for Mr. Smith. Yeah, that's right. I was making his favorite dish, chicken parmesan. (nervous laughter) Oh, and I remember thinking about how nice it smelled, but then I heard a noise and went to investigate... *fidgets*
[2025-08-18T09:10:13.151Z] USER -> Lena Blackwood: you went to investigate? which noise was it, what did it sound like?
[2025-08-18T09:10:18.204Z] AI(Lena Blackwood) -> USER: Um, it was just a creak, I think. Yeah, the old house can be pretty creaky at times. (gulps) But then I saw... nothing out of the ordinary. Just my imagination running wild, probably. (twitches) I mean, what could I have possibly seen that would make me suspicious? *fidgets with hands*
[2025-08-18T09:11:08.551Z] USER -> Lena Blackwood: Calm down, captain, I didn't say you were suspicious, I am merely asking what you investigated. you seem nervous
[2025-08-18T09:11:14.381Z] AI(Lena Blackwood) -> USER: I'm just... anxious, that's all. (nervous laughter) Okay, fine. So, I went to the study, and I saw... nothing. But I did notice that the window was open, which is strange because it was closed when I left Mr. Smith earlier. (pauses, glancing around the room) And I remember thinking how silly it would be for me to forget to close it, but... (trails off, looking down)
[2025-08-18T09:11:32.139Z] USER -> Lena Blackwood: but...?
[2025-08-18T09:11:37.832Z] AI(Lena Blackwood) -> USER: But nothing, just a silly thought. (fidgets with hands again) I mean, I'm sure it was just the wind or something. I didn't touch anything out of place, if that's what you're thinking. *pauses to glance at a broken vase on the nearby table* Oh, look at that vase. I broke it earlier today, trying to dust it. (nervous smile) Must have been my clumsiness...
