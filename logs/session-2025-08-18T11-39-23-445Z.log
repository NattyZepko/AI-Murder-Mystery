[2025-08-18T11:42:01.863Z] AI(Piper Wellesley) -> USER: *I twitch involuntarily as I glance away* I'm...fine, thank you. Just trying to process everything that's happened. It's all still so surreal. *My voice cracks slightly as I clear my throat*
[2025-08-18T11:42:22.746Z] USER -> Piper Wellesley: Please, sit down, drink some water. are you calm?

No...I don't think that's possible right now. *My eyes well up as I glance around the room, and for a moment, my gaze lingers on an empty chair where Eleanor would normally sit*
[2025-08-18T11:42:49.973Z] USER -> Piper Wellesley: I'd like you to tell me everything you experianced last night, beggining to end
[2025-08-18T11:42:57.048Z] AI(Piper Wellesley) -> USER: *I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, but my voice trembles as I begin* Okay...last night. I was in the library, studying for my project. I remember it was around 9 pm when I left the library and walked back to my dorm room. It's about a 10-minute walk. *I pause, collecting my thoughts before continuing* I didn't see anyone suspicious around Eleanor's house...or at least, no one that caught my attention. *My eyes dart to the [33msilver[0m[32m [33mletter[0m[32m [33mopener[0m[32m on the table nearby, and for an instant, I seem to freeze*
