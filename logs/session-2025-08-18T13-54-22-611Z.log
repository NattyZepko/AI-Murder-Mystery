[2025-08-18T13:55:52.305Z] USER -> Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel: Hey patel, whats your relationship with the deceased?
[2025-08-18T13:55:59.279Z] AI(Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel) -> USER: Dr. Patel... he was a colleague, a research partner... we were working on a top-secret project together. I'm still trying to process what happened. *shakes head* We were like family in here; it's hard to believe he's gone.
[2025-08-18T13:56:26.738Z] USER -> Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel: aren't you actual family? don't you have the same last name? what's your last name, and what's the deceased last name?
[2025-08-18T13:56:33.207Z] AI(Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel) -> USER: My last name is Patel... *pauses* And Dr. Patel's last name was... well, it's the same as mine, of course. He was my father. We were working together on a project, but that doesn't mean I had any... motive to harm him. *looks down, trying to maintain composure*
[2025-08-18T13:56:48.367Z] USER -> Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel: who saw you yesterday?
[2025-08-18T13:56:54.818Z] AI(Rashmi 'The Nurse' Patel) -> USER: Well... [31mBenny 'The Brain' Lee[0m[32m was in the infirmary around the time I was providing medical care for a patient. He came by to ask about some technical issue with one of our life support systems. And, of course, [31mCaptain Zara Blackwood[0m[32m was on duty in the control room, but we didn't interact directly... *trails off*
[2025-08-18T13:57:16.105Z] USER -> Captain Zara Blackwood: hello, where were you last night?
[2025-08-18T13:57:22.080Z] AI(Captain Zara Blackwood) -> USER: I was on duty in the control room at the time of the murder. I had a team working with me, and we were monitoring the station's systems. It's standard procedure for someone to be on watch during that shift.
[2025-08-18T13:57:32.656Z] USER -> Captain Zara Blackwood: who saw you?
[2025-08-18T13:57:39.444Z] AI(Captain Zara Blackwood) -> USER: [31mBenny 'The Brain' Lee[0m[32m was one of my team members. He can vouch for my presence in the control room. And, I think [31mRashmi 'The Nurse' Patel[0m[32m also stopped by to check on some system logs. She's a friend and colleague, and I'm sure she'll confirm my alibi if needed.
[2025-08-18T13:58:02.770Z] USER -> Lena 'The Engineer' Kim: where were you last night, and who saw you?
[2025-08-18T13:58:09.338Z] AI(Lena 'The Engineer' Kim) -> USER: I was working on a top-secret project in the engineering bay around the time of the murder. [31mBenny 'The Brain' Lee[0m[32m can vouch for me - we were both there, tinkering with some new robotics designs. I remember he was fiddling with a particularly tricky circuit board while I... (pauses) ...while I was testing the [33mZero-G [33mPouch[0m[32m[0m[32m's stabilizers nearby.
[2025-08-18T13:58:49.409Z] USER -> Benny 'The Brain' Lee: certainly many people vouch for you for yesterday, but who can you vouch for? who did you see yeterday? where were you?
[2025-08-18T13:58:57.274Z] AI(Benny 'The Brain' Lee) -> USER: I was in the engineering bay, working on a critical repair, and [31mCaptain Zara Blackwood[0m[32m verified my alibi. I also saw [31mRashmi 'The Nurse' Patel[0m[32m rushing to provide medical care in the infirmary around that time. She's usually quite diligent about her duties... (twitches fingers) By the way, have you seen the [33mGraviton [33mDisruptor[0m[32m[0m[32m lying around? That thing's a real puzzle piece.
[2025-08-18T14:18:42.883Z] USER -> Benny 'The Brain' Lee: no, where do you think it could be?
[2025-08-18T14:18:50.045Z] AI(Benny 'The Brain' Lee) -> USER: I don't know... (fidgets) It's probably in the research lab, where Dr. Patel was working on that top-secret project. I mean, she was always messing around with that [33mGraviton [33mDisruptor[0m[32m. But I'm sure it's not connected to her death... (gulps) Or is it?
