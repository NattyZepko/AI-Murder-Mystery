[2025-08-18T08:59:10.753Z] USER -> Lysander Flynn: Hello, Lysander, how are you this evening?
[2025-08-18T08:59:15.046Z] AI(Lysander Flynn) -> USER: *nervous fidgeting* I'm... fine, thank you for asking. Just a bit shaken up by all of this, to be honest. *avoids eye contact*
[2025-08-18T08:59:36.784Z] USER -> Lysander Flynn: why are you avoiding my eyes? where were you yesterday at 11:47 PM?
[2025-08-18T08:59:41.088Z] AI(Lysander Flynn) -> USER: *twitches* I was in the kitchen... making some tea. Yeah, that's right. I remember now. The kettle was still going when I left to... uh, get some books from the library. *fidgets with hands*
[2025-08-18T09:00:09.206Z] USER -> Lysander Flynn: you seem nervous, which book did you take from the library?
[2025-08-18T09:00:13.541Z] AI(Lysander Flynn) -> USER: *gulps* Ah, just a, uh, a history text. Nothing important. I was just trying to distract myself from... everything that's been going on. *glances at hands, then looks away again*
[2025-08-18T09:00:26.283Z] USER -> Lysander Flynn: what has been going on lately?
[2025-08-18T09:00:30.993Z] AI(Lysander Flynn) -> USER: *swallows hard* Dr. Vex had been... breathing down my neck. Asking too many questions about my past. I felt like she was trying to intimidate me. *pauses, eyes darting around the room* But that's not relevant, is it? *avoids direct eye contact again*
[2025-08-18T09:01:04.570Z] USER -> Astrid Nightshade: hello astrid, where were you yesterday at 11:47 PM?
[2025-08-18T09:01:09.437Z] AI(Astrid Nightshade) -> USER: *I pace agitatedly* I was in my laboratory, working on a project. You can ask my assistant, she'll vouch for me... *muttering under breath* Unlike some people who claim to have an alibi but are clearly lying... *glances at the detective with a hint of accusation*
[2025-08-18T09:01:37.113Z] USER -> Astrid Nightshade: who would you say is the most likely to be lying?
[2025-08-18T09:01:42.874Z] AI(Astrid Nightshade) -> USER: *I scowl, eyes narrowing* Dr. Vex's assistant, Elara. She's been trying to sabotage my research for months. I've seen her sneaking around the lab at odd hours... *pauses, glancing around the room* And I'm sure she'd love to take credit for killing her boss and ruining his precious research. *leans in, voice taking on a conspiratorial tone* If you ask me, that letter opener of hers looks suspiciously clean...
