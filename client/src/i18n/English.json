      "howPlay_q": "How do I play?",
      "howPlay_a": "Read the scenario, talk to suspects, gather clues, and try to deduce who the culprit is. Use the chat to ask questions and submit your accusation when you think you know who did it, and with what weapon. If you don't have the correct weapon, try investigating some more.",
      "canLose_q": "Can I lose the game?",
      "canLose_a": "No. If you accuse the wrong suspect, the case remains unsolved, but you can just keep investigating or guessing. The Engine is entirely run by AI, so it will adapt to your actions, but it isn't perfect. If you encounter any troubles at all, try a new scenario.",

      "sameStory_a": "No, each game generates a new scenario with different suspects, motives, and clues.",
