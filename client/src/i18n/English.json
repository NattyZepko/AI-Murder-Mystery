    "p1": "Hi! My name is Natty (נתי). I love games, stories, and programming, so I decided to do a project that combines them all together.",
    "p1b": "This is a side project that I built myself and with the help of artificial intelligence. The goal of the project was to see what artificial intelligence can do in developing and creating gaming and entertainment experiences.",
    "p1c": "The project is an interesting solution to a problem that game developers all over the world have been dreaming about for years: a fully automated experience, not predetermined, a dynamic game (like D&D) - but automatic, independent, and unique every time. The experience that will respond appropriately to the behavior of the player, no matter who, and will always respond in context. This is where the AI ​​element comes in. It is a tool that will undoubtedly grow and take root in almost every area of ​​our lives in the future and I am happy to try it out in the world of games.",
