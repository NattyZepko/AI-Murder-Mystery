## Live demo plan

1. Generate a new case and show the suspect list
2. Ask a suspect a couple of questions live
3. Point out the clues that appear as replies are parsed
4. Make an accusation and reveal the answer

<aside class="notes">Keep the demo short and focused: show the roleplay quality and the clue extraction in action. If anything technical comes up, frame it as "behind the scenes" support that helps the game flow.</aside>
